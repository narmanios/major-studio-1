## Sketches

## Sketch 1: "Timeline in Red and Blue: Revolutionary War Collections, 1770–1810"

Description: This visualization presents each year from 1770 to 1810 as a bar, with blue marking the pre war years up to 1775 and red marking the Revolutionary period and its aftermath. The goal is to explore questions such as: How do artifacts cluster around key moments of the Revolution? Which categories such as paintings, portraits, silhouettes, etc dominate at different points in time?

The visualization provides annual totals of objects across categories. Together they show the scale and distribution of preserved works.

The visualization combines a bar chart timeline with overlaid line charts.

## Sketch 2: "Mapping a Revolution: Smithsonian Collections, 1770–1810"

Description: This visualization traces Revolutionary War collections across the thirteen colonies from 1770 to 1810, highlighting both temporal and geographic patterns in the Smithsonian’s collections. It asks: How are artifacts distributed across geography and time? Quantitatively, the visualization includes yearly counts by category, revealing changes in the number and type of works preserved across four decades.

The map locates artifacts according to whether they were created in a colony, discovered there, or donated by someone connected to that place.

The design uses an interactive map of the thirteen colonies.

## Sketch 3: "Revolution in Pieces: Visualizing Collections, 1770–1810"

Description: This visualization explores Smithsonian collections of the Revolutionary period by paintings, prints, portraits, and more. Horizontally stacked color bars above each category reveal the scale of each type. Users can select works across different years within a category, piecing together a broader picture of America’s Revolution.

This visualization looks at patterns that emerge when selecting works from multiple years within a single category? How do differences in category numbers reflect what was created, preserved, or collected over time?

This visualization is broader view of how America’s Revolution was captured and remembered by the Smithsonian.

It uses stacked bar charts to show the scale of each category and filters that allows users to select works across different years.
