## Sketch 2: ”Multiple Lenses on Revolutionary Portraits: Medium, Color, Period, Gender, and Sitter”

Description: This sketch shows Revolutionary War portraits (1770–1810) organized through five qualitative lenses: medium, color, period, gender, and sitter–artist relationships. Each category highlights different qualities of the artworks, with a central portrait silhouette acting as a focal point. The aim is to reveal stylistic, emotional, and social dimensions beyond simple counts or dates.
