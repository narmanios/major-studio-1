                        <p>Silhouette Art of Early America is a data visualization project inspired by the
                            work of William Bache, an early 19th century artist who used a device called a
                            physiognotrace to
                            create
                            nearly 2,000 silhouette portraits. Traveling from Philadelphia to New Orleans and into the
                            Caribbean,
                            Bache captured a wide cross section of American society from politicians, to artisans and
                            merchants to men and women and
                            people of African descent. His silhouettes were digitized by the
                            Smithsonian’s
                            National
                            Portrait Gallery, and offers a glimpse into the lives of everyday people in early
                            American
                            history.</p>

                        <p>This project transforms those silhouettes into interactive data. Who sat for him, both
                            identified and unidentified, including some of the founding fathers' of the United States
                            can be explored and examined. These silhouettes tell as story of the identity and
                            representation in
                            early America. Viewers can filter the collection by gender and identification status,
                            inviting
                            viewers to explore these portraits not just as images, but as entries into a larger
                            narrative about the past.</p>

                        <p>
                            Silhouette Art of Early America is a data visualization project inspired by the
                            work of William Bache, an early 19th century artist who used a device called a
                            physiognotrace to
                            create
                            nearly 2,000 silhouette portraits. Traveling throughout the eastern seaboard of the United
                            States and to the
                            Caribbean and Cuba,
                            Bache captured a wide cross section of American society from politicians, to artisans and
                            merchants to men and women and
                            people of African descent. His silhouettes were digitized by the
                            Smithsonian’s
                            National
                            Portrait Gallery, and offers a glimpse into the lives of everyday people in early
                            American
                            history.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>This project transforms those silhouettes into interactive data. A selection of any number of
                            silhouettes can be made, viewed as a collection and explored through the tracing of
                            their outlines. The outlines of the silhouettes highlight the outlines that William Bache
                            made as he created these art pieces of his sitters. Viewers can also filter the collection
                            by gender. This project invites one to explore these portraits not just as silhouettes but
                            as a window into the image of early America and its past.</p>
