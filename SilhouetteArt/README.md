### Traced in Shadow: The Silhouette Sitters Diverse Faces of Early America

Silhouette Art of Early America is a data visualization project inspired by the work of William Bache, an early 19th century artist who used a device called a physiognotrace to create nearly 2,000 silhouette portraits.

This project transforms those silhouettes into interactive data. Who sat for him, both identified and unidentified, including some of the founding fathers' of the United States. Viewers can filter the collection by gender and identification status, inviting viewers to explore these portraits not just as images, but as entries into a larger narrative about the past.
