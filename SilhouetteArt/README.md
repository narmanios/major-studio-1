Silhouette Art of Early America is a data visualization project inspired by the work of William Bache, an early 19th century artist who used a device called a physiognotrace to create nearly 2,000 silhouette portraits.

This project transforms those silhouettes into interactive data. A selection of any number of silhouettes can be made, viewed as a collection and explored through the tracing of their outlines. The outlines of the silhouettes highlight the outlines that William Bache made as he created these art pieces of his sitters. Viewers can also filter the collection by gender. This project invites one to explore these portraits not just as silhouettes but as a window into the image of early America and its past.
